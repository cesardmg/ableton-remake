        We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between
        our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.

        Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use
        Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
        professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
        and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared
        belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to
        something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.
